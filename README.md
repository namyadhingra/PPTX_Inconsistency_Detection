# AI-Powered PowerPoint Inconsistency Detector

An intelligent Python tool that analyzes multi-slide PowerPoint presentations to identify factual and logical inconsistencies across slides using both rule-based detection and AI-powered analysis.

## Problem Statement

Modern presentations often contain complex data, metrics, and claims that span multiple slides. Manual review for consistency is time-consuming and error-prone, especially in large decks with numerical data, timelines, and interconnected claims. This tool addresses the need for automated detection of:

- **Conflicting numerical data** (revenue figures, percentages, time savings)
- **Contradictory textual claims** (opposing statements about market conditions, capabilities)
- **Timeline mismatches** (conflicting dates, forecasts, sequences)
- **Mathematical errors** (breakdown components not summing to totals)
- **Unit inconsistencies** (mixing time units, currency formats)

## Key Features

### üîç **Dual Analysis Approach**
- **Rule-based detection**: Fast, reliable pattern matching for common inconsistency types
- **AI-powered analysis**: Deep contextual understanding using Gemini 2.5 Flash API

### üìä **Multi-source Text Extraction**
- **Primary**: Direct text extraction from PPTX files using python-pptx
- **Fallback**: OCR processing of slide images using Tesseract
- **Hybrid**: Combines both sources for maximum accuracy

### üéØ **Specialized Detectors**
- **Impact Value Conflicts**: Detects conflicting monetary amounts and savings claims
- **Time Savings Analysis**: Identifies inconsistent time metrics with unit normalization
- **Mathematical Validation**: Verifies that breakdown components sum to claimed totals
- **Unit Mixing Detection**: Flags confusion between different time/currency units
- **Contextual Analysis**: AI-driven detection of subtle logical inconsistencies

### üìà **Enhanced Reporting**
- Severity-based classification (High/Medium/Low priority)
- Detailed slide references and context
- Structured JSON output for programmatic use
- Clear terminal summaries with actionable insights

## Installation

### Option 1: Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

### Option 2: Conda Environment

```bash
# Create conda environment
conda create -n ppt-analyzer python=3.9

# Activate environment
conda activate ppt-analyzer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Tesseract OCR**: Required for image text extraction
  - Windows: Download from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
  - macOS: `brew install tesseract`
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`

## Configuration

### API Key Setup
1. Obtain a free Gemini 2.5 Flash API key from [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
my_api_key=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### Dependencies
The tool requires these packages (specified in `dependencies.txt`):
- `python-pptx==1.0.2` - PowerPoint file processing
- `Pillow==11.3.0` - Image handling
- `pytesseract==0.3.13` - OCR text extraction
- `dateparser==1.2.2` - Date parsing and normalization
- `google-generativeai==0.8.5` - Gemini AI integration
- `python-dotenv==1.1.1` - Environment variable management
- `tqdm==4.67.1` - Progress bars
- `lxml==6.0.0` - XML processing
- `requests==2.32.4` - HTTP requests

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python inconsistency_detector.py
```

The script will prompt for:
- PPTX file path (auto-detects if in project directory)
- Images folder path (for OCR fallback)

### Input Options
1. **PPTX + Images**: Best accuracy, uses both text extraction and OCR
2. **PPTX only**: Fast processing, relies on embedded text
3. **Images only**: OCR-based analysis for image-only presentations

### Output
- **Terminal**: Real-time progress and summary of findings
- **JSON Report**: Detailed analysis saved as `inconsistencies_enhanced.json`

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Text Extraction Phase**
   - Direct PPTX text extraction with embedded image OCR
   - Batch OCR processing of slide images with progress tracking

2. **Normalization Phase**
   - Number extraction with currency/percentage recognition
   - Date parsing with format standardization
   - Context preservation for semantic analysis

3. **Rule-based Detection**
   - Pattern matching for common inconsistency types
   - Mathematical validation of sums and breakdowns
   - Unit normalization and conflict detection

4. **AI-Enhanced Analysis**
   - Contextual understanding of claims and relationships
   - Batch processing to optimize API usage (8 slides per request)
   - Semantic inconsistency detection beyond pattern matching
