# AI-Powered PowerPoint Inconsistency Detector v4.0

AI-Powered PowerPoint Inconsistency Detector is a Python tool that scans multi-slide PowerPoint decks to detect factual, numerical, and logical inconsistencies. It combines rule-based checks for quick wins with Gemini AI for deep, context-aware analysis, making review faster, more accurate, and scalable for presentations of any size.

## Problem Statement

Modern presentations often contain complex data, metrics, and claims that span multiple slides. Manual review for consistency is time-consuming and error-prone, especially in large decks with numerical data, timelines, and interconnected claims. This tool addresses the need for automated detection of:

- **Conflicting numerical data** (revenue figures, percentages, time savings)
- **Contradictory textual claims** (opposing statements about market conditions, capabilities)
- **Timeline mismatches** (conflicting dates, forecasts, sequences)
- **Mathematical errors** (breakdown components not summing to totals)
- **Unit inconsistencies** (mixing time units, currency formats)

## üìÑ Project Report

The comprehensive project report documenting the development process, technical approach, and evaluation results is available at:

```PPTX_Inconsistency_Detection/docs/```

The report includes detailed analysis of the tool's evolution to an enterprise-ready solution, performance metrics, and evaluation criteria alignment.

## Key Features

### üîç **Dual Analysis Approach**
- **Rule-based detection**: Fast, reliable pattern matching for common inconsistency types
- **AI-powered analysis**: Deep contextual understanding using Gemini 2.5 Flash API

### üìä **Multi-source Text Extraction**
- **Primary**: Direct text extraction from PPTX files using python-pptx
- **Fallback**: OCR processing of slide images using Tesseract
- **Hybrid**: Combines both sources for maximum accuracy

### üöÄ **Enterprise-Grade Scalability**
The tool automatically detects presentation size and adapts its processing strategy:

#### For Large Presentations (50+ slides):
- **Memory-Efficient Chunked Processing**: Processes slides in batches of 15 to handle presentations with hundreds of slides without memory issues
- **Parallel OCR Processing**: Multi-threaded OCR with configurable worker pools (up to 8 workers) for faster image processing
- **OCR Result Caching**: MD5-based LRU cache prevents reprocessing identical images (common in templates with repeated headers/footers)
- **API Rate Limiting**: Smart throttling (12 calls/minute) with exponential backoff to prevent hitting Gemini API limits during large batch operations
- **Lightweight Output**: Generates summary reports instead of full slide data to manage file sizes

#### For Small Presentations (<50 slides):
- **Standard Processing**: Fast, straightforward analysis using 4 OCR workers without enterprise overhead
- **Full Data Retention**: Includes complete slide content in output for detailed analysis
- **Batch Processing**: Processes slides in batches of 6 for optimal API efficiency

*Note: Features like OCR caching and API rate limiting add complexity that's unnecessary for small-scale presentations but become critical for enterprise-level document processing.*

### üéØ **Specialized Detectors**
- **Impact Value Conflicts**: Detects conflicting monetary amounts ($2M vs $3M) with currency normalization
- **Time Savings Analysis**: Identifies inconsistent time metrics with unit normalization (minutes ‚Üî hours)
- **Mathematical Validation**: Verifies that breakdown components sum to claimed totals
- **Unit Mixing Detection**: Flags confusion between different time/currency units (per year vs per month)
- **Contextual Numeric Analysis**: Context-aware detection of conflicting values within categories
- **Percentage Sum Validation**: Ensures percentages sum to approximately 100% (¬±2% tolerance)

### üìà **Enhanced Reporting **
- **Detailed Issue Breakdown**: Each issue shows specific evidence, claimed vs actual values, and breakdown details
- **Numbered AI Issues**: LLM-detected issues are numbered and formatted with proper text wrapping
- **Evidence Display**: Shows specific conflicting values and their locations
- **Enhanced Summary**: Includes analysis summary with recommendations and context
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear step-by-step progress indicators
- **Proper Slide References**: All issues properly reference slide numbers
- Severity-based classification (High/Medium/Low priority)
- Structured JSON output for programmatic use
- Professional formatting with text wrapping and indentation

## Limitations & Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **API Dependency**: Deep analysis requires Gemini API (free tier: ~250 requests/day)
- **OCR Accuracy**: Complex layouts or poor image quality may affect text extraction
- **Language Support**: Optimized for English presentations only
- **Rate Limits**: Large presentations may require extended processing time due to API throttling

### Scalability Considerations
- **Enterprise Features**: MD5 caching and rate limiting add complexity for small presentations
- **Memory Trade-offs**: Large presentation mode prioritizes efficiency over complete data retention
- **Processing Time**: Rate limiting extends processing time for large decks
- **Chunk Size**: 15-slide chunks balance memory efficiency with processing overhead

### Future Enhancements
- Support for additional file formats (PDF, Google Slides)
- Multi-language inconsistency detection
- Custom rule definition interface
- Integration with presentation authoring tools
- Distributed processing for extremely large document collections
