Your task is to build an AI enabled Python script/tool that processes any multi-slide PowerPoint presentation and finds factual or logical inconsistencies across the slides. These could be:

Conflicting numerical data (e.g., revenue figures that don’t match, percentages that don’t add up)

Contradictory textual claims (e.g., “market is highly competitive” vs “few competitors”)

Timeline mismatches (e.g., dates or forecasts that conflict)
etc
What we provide:
A sample PowerPoint deck with images containing inconsistencies. You can use both the pptx and images of slides.

Your deliverable:
A Python script or agent that runs in a terminal and analyzes pptx and images to flag inconsistencies, producing a clear and structured output referencing slide numbers and the nature of each issue. This should be generalized. 

Do not make a UI, we are not assessing this.

Use gemini 2.5 flash to make comparison fair (free api key here: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

Share your code as a git repo with an explanation of features, functionality and limitations

Evaluation criteria:
Accuracy and completeness of inconsistency detection

Clarity and usability of the output

Scalability, generalisability and robustness to large decks

Thoughtfulness of approach and explanation of features, functionality and limitations
