🚨 HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES DETECTED:
  - Impact Value Conflict (Slides 1, 2, 7): Found conflicting impact values: [2000000.0, 3000000.0]
    → Evidence: [2000000.0, 3000000.0]
  - Sum Breakdown Mismatch (Slide 3): Claimed total (50) doesn't match sum of breakdown (80)
    → Claimed Total: 50
    → Actual Sum: 80
    → Breakdown: [10, 12, 8, 6, 4, 10, 12, 8, 6, 4]

⚠️  MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES:
  - Unit Mixing Confusion (Slides 3): Same metric presented in different time units causing potential confusion
    → Mixed Units Found:
      • Slide 3: 50 per_month
      • Slide 3: 10 per_month
      • Slide 3: 12 per_month
      • Slide 3: 8 per_month
      • Slide 3: 6 per_month
      • Slide 3: 4 per_month
      • Slide 3: 10 per_month
      • Slide 3: 12 per_month
      • Slide 3: 8 per_month
      • Slide 3: 6 per_month
      • Slide 3: 4 per_month

🔍 AI-DETECTED ISSUES:
  1. Major Monetary Conflict:
     The claimed 'Impact' or 'saved productivity hours annually' for Noogat
     changes significantly between Slide 1 and Slide 2. Slide 1 states '$2M'
     impact, while Slide 2 claims '$3M saved in lost productivity hours
     annually'. This represents a 50% difference ($1M difference on a $2M base),
     which is a major monetary conflict.

  2. Significant Time Savings Conflict:
     The claimed time saved per slide created by Noogat varies between Slide 1
     and Slide 2. Slide 1 states '15 mins Saved per slide created', whereas
     Slide 2 claims '20 mins saved per slide created'. This is a 33% difference
     (5 minutes difference on a 15-minute base), indicating a significant time
     savings inconsistency.

  3. Direct Contradiction:
     The claimed speed improvement for deck creation using Noogat directly
     contradicts itself. Slide 1 states 'decks 2x faster using AI', while Slide
     2 claims '3x faster deck creation speed'. This is a clear and direct
     contradiction regarding a core benefit.

  4. Mathematical Errors In Totals And Direct Contradictions:
     The total monthly time savings attributed to Noogat varies significantly
     across multiple slides, and the headline on Slide 3 does not match the sum
     of its own details or the details on other slides.  - Slide 3 Headline: '50
     Hours Saved Per Consultant Monthly'. - Slide 3 & 4 detailed breakdown (10 +
     12 + 8 hours): Sums to 30 hours. - Slide 5 detailed breakdown (10 + 12 + 8
     + 6 + 4 hours): Sums to 40 hours. This presents multiple mathematical
     errors and contradictions for a key performance metric (50 hours vs 30
     hours vs 40 hours).

  5. Direct Contradiction Regarding Competitive Positioning:
     Slide 6 explicitly states 'Key Limitations of Copilot Compared to Gamma's
     Superior Slide Capabilities', implying Gamma is superior to Copilot.
     However, the quantitative time savings data presented in both Slide 4 and
     Slide 5 consistently shows Copilot achieving significantly higher monthly
     time savings than Gamma across all categories and in total (e.g., Slide 5
     shows Copilot at 10.5 hours vs Gamma at 5.7 hours). This directly
     contradicts the qualitative claim of Gamma's superiority.

  6. Significant Time Savings Conflict:
     The individual time savings (12 + 8 + 6 + 4 = 30 hours saved per
     consultant/month) are not explicitly reconciled with the 'Overall
     Productivity Gains' metric of '15 minutes saved per slide created'. Without
     stating the average number of slides a consultant creates per month, it's
     impossible for the audience to verify how the specific component savings
     translate into the overall per-slide saving.

  7. Direct Contradiction / Ambiguity:
     The 'Overall Productivity Gains' row presents a 'Current Status' that is a
     per-unit time saving ('Achieving 15 minutes saved per slide created') while
     its 'Key Objective' includes both a qualitative benefit ('Enable focus on
     high-value tasks') and a major monetary target ('save $2M in lost
     productivity'). This mixes different types of metrics and objectives,
     leading to significant ambiguity about what this overall category is truly
     measuring or aiming to achieve.

  8. Major Monetary Conflict / Unsubstantiated Claim:
     The high-impact claim to 'save $2M in lost productivity' is presented
     without any supporting data or context. Critical information such as the
     number of consultants impacted, their average cost, or the timeframe over
     which this $2M saving occurs (e.g., annually, one-time) is missing, making
     the monetary claim unverifiable and potentially misleading.

  9. Mathematical Inconsistency / Unstated Assumption:
     To make the summed individual time savings (30 hours per consultant/month)
     consistent with the 'Overall Productivity Gains' of 15 minutes saved per
     slide, a critical implicit assumption is required: each consultant must
     produce exactly 120 slides per month (30 hours * 60 minutes/hour / 15
     minutes/slide). This crucial, unstated assumption means the presented
     figures are conditionally consistent, not explicitly so, creating a gap in
     the data's integrity.
